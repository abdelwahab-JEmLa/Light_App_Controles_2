# Skill - Fix TODOs (t_)

This skill instructs the assistant on how to automatically search for, identify, and fix `TODO` comments in the active codebase, and display a detailed code diff at the end of the explanations.

Additionally, this skill supports the **`t_models`** sub-trigger, which automatically adds `appDatabase.kt` and the `Models` package to the active restricted context before proceeding with the standard steps.

If **`t_usage`** is triggered, the assistant will also compute and display the percentage and amount of model tokens consumed so far, and what remains in the current session (out of the calibrated 200,000 token limit) at the end of the execution report.

**Central Dispatcher Capability**: If a `TODO` comment contains a trigger phrase for another custom skill (e.g., `TODO: log_`, `TODO: sem_`, `TODO: con_c`, `TODO: cop_`), the assistant must automatically chain and execute the corresponding custom skill's steps on that file/package, rather than applying a manual code fix.

- "t_usage"
- "fix_todo"
- "fix_todos"

## Steps to Execute

### When "t_models" is triggered:

#### 1. Add appDatabase.kt and Models packages to Context (cwa_)
Automatically invoke the context addition (`cwa_`) rules for the following packages:
- **`AppDatabase`** (Package: `com.example.light_app_controles.Modules.Base.SQL.Daos`)
- **`Models`** (Package: `EntreApps.Shared.Models`)

Generate and append the folder rules to [.antigravityignore](file:///C:/Users/Abou%20Mohamed/AndroidStudioProjects/Light_App_Controles/.antigravityignore) and [.geminiignore](file:///C:/Users/Abou%20Mohamed/AndroidStudioProjects/Light_App_Controles/.geminiignore):

```

#### 2. Execute standard TODO fixing
Proceed directly to the standard steps below to locate and fix TODOs.

### When "t_usage" is triggered:

#### 1. Calculate and Report Token Usage
At the end of the standard execution steps, estimate the total token count of the current conversation (using the transcript file size `transcript_full.jsonl` size in bytes / 4 + system context overhead of ~15,000 tokens) and calculate what percentage of the calibrated 200,000 token limit this represents. Output both the consumed token percentage and amount, as well as the remaining token amount and percentage prominently at the end of the report.

### Standard Steps to Execute:

### 1. Locate outstanding TODOs in the codebase
Search the codebase to find any outstanding `TODO` comments using the `grep_search` tool:
- Query: `TODO`
- SearchPath: `C:\Users\Abou Mohamed\AndroidStudioProjects\Light_App_Controles\app\src\main\java`

### 2. Implement the fixes in Code / Delegate to Skills
- **Skill Dispatcher Check**: For each found `TODO` comment, check if it contains a trigger for another custom skill:
  - If it contains `log_` (e.g. `TODO: log_`), execute the **Real-Time Logcat Inspector (log_)** skill steps.
  - If it contains `sem_` (e.g. `TODO: sem_`), execute the **Semantics Inspector (sem_)** skill steps.
  - If it contains `con_` (e.g. `TODO: con_c` or `TODO: co_`), execute the **Concise Code (consize_comments)** skill steps.
  - If it contains `cop_` (e.g. `TODO: cop_`), execute the **Copy Package / Sibling Files (cop_last)** skill steps.
- **Standard Fixes**: If no skill trigger is matched, analyze the `TODO` comment requirements, apply the appropriate manual code fixes, and delete the comment using `replace_file_content` or `multi_replace_file_content`.

### 3. Report Success and Display Code Diffs
Provide the user with a detailed report including:
- Clickable links to the modified files.
- **A detailed git-style code diff showing all modified files at the very end of your explanations (unless the task delegated to the `sem_` skill, in which case DO NOT show the git-style code changes/diffs, only display the semantics details/infos).**
