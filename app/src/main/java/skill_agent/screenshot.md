## Steps to Execute

### 1. Capture the Screen
Run the `android screen capture` command to capture the device screen. Always save it to a standard file name like `screen.png` in the workspace directory:
```powershell
android screen capture -a -o screen.png
```

### 2. View/Display the Screenshot
Immediately read and display the screenshot to the user using the `view_file` tool:
- Path: `C:\Users\Abou Mohamed\AndroidStudioProjects\Light_App_Controles\screen.png`

### 3. Report Success
Provide the user with a direct markdown link to the screenshot file and describe the screen content if needed.
