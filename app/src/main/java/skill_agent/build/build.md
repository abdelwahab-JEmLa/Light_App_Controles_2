## Steps to Execute

### 1. Execute the Gradle Install Task
Run the Gradle wrapper script `gradlew.bat` with the `installDebug` task in the project root directory (`C:\Users\Abou Mohamed\AndroidStudioProjects\Light_App_Controles`):
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat installDebug --offline --parallel --build-cache --configuration-cache
```

### 2. Verify Output
- Monitor the build progress.
- If the build succeeds and shows `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, inform the user.
- If the build fails, parse the compilation errors and present them to the user with references to the files.
