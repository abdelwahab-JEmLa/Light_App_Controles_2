# Skill - Client JetPack Fix TODOs & Coding Patterns (t_appClient_chain_todo)

This skill instructs the assistant on how to automatically search for, identify, and resolve `TODO` comments in the external `ClientJetPack` project codebase. It functions exactly like the standard `t_` skill, but targets the client application directories, searching for relative/chained TODOs to understand the expected coding patterns before applying fixes.

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Locate outstanding TODOs in the Client codebase
The absolute fastest way to locate all TODO comments in the client codebase is using the `grep_search` tool with the query `TODO` on the following target paths:
- **Path 1**: `D:\AndroidStudioProjects\ClientJetPack\app\src\main\java`
- **Path 2**: `D:\AndroidStudioProjects\ClientJetPack\app\src\androidTest\java`

Analyze comments such as:
- `//<--` or `//<-` pointers.
- Chained relative comments (e.g. `//TODO(2.C Relative Au Todo(1):` or `//TODO(1):`).
- Comments indicating expected structure or template code (e.g., `//...`).
Use these indicators to understand the exact coding patterns required for the implementation.

### 2. Implement the fixes in Client Code
- Analyze the `TODO` requirements and their relationships/dependencies (e.g. implementing dependent fixes in the correct order).
- Search for surrounding code patterns in the codebase to match the coding style (e.g. variables, database calls, ViewModels, or test assertions).
- Apply the appropriate manual code fixes using file editing tools (such as `replace_file_content` or `multi_replace_file_content`).

### 3. Clean up the Code
- Remove the resolved `TODO` comments from the file.
- Thoroughly clean up any associated pointer/indicator comments (such as `//<--`, `//<-`, `//...`) from adjacent lines to keep the code perfectly clean.

### 4. Report Success and Display Code Diffs
Provide the user with a detailed report including:
- Clickable links to the modified files in the `ClientJetPack` project.
- **Always display the time 1:30 to complete the quest (e.g., "Temps estimé pour terminer la quête : 1:30").**
- A detailed git-style code diff showing all modified files at the very end of your explanations.
